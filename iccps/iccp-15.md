## Summary:

This proposal aims to streamline the Vote of No Confidence (VoNC) process, prioritizing clarity, equal opportunity, and efficiency. By introducing clear actions and guidelines, it ensures a well-organized approach for all stakeholders. The changes empower both the DAO and the council member in question, allowing for an equitable assessment and maintaining the community's integrity. 

## Process:

### Initiation of VoNC:

Any ILV holder/staker is able to initiate a VoNC for any seated council member whether in the Illuvium Main Council (IMC) or in the Illuvium Community Council (ICC) by filling a Google Form with the following information:

**a) Email of Initiator (required)** - The initiator's email is a necessary requirement, primarily for communication purposes. Providing a copy of the form to the initiator's email ensures that they have a record of their submission and any updates related to the VoNC. The email will not be shared with the public.

**b) Discord ID or Name (optional)** - Recognizing that some individuals may have valid concerns but prefer to remain anonymous, we make the Discord ID optional. Anonymity is crucial in encouraging individuals to come forward without fear of reprisal, fostering a culture of openness and accountability. 

A VoNC is determined by the weight of the allegations coupled with its evidence rather than who filed the complaint. This principle ensures that the process is objective and fair, focusing on the merit of the concerns rather than the identity of the initiator.

**c) Recipient of the VoNC** -  Clearly identifying the council member/s targeted by the VoNC is essential to avoid confusion and ensure that the process is directed at the correct individual/s.

**d) Reason/s for the VoNC** (multiple choices can be selected) -
- Non-performance: Issues related to council members' attendance, participation in meetings, and responsiveness to proposals.
- Conduct contrary to DAO: Actions that are detrimental to the DAO or project, safeguarding the community's interests.
- Gross Violation of the Code of Ethics: Major violations or a pattern of behavior that contradicts the community's Code of Ethics.
- False or Misrepresentation of Information (nomination or otherwise)
- Others: This option permits initiators to describe unique circumstances that may not fit into the predefined categories.

**e) Rationale** - summarize why the council member should be subject to a VoNC. This step ensures clarity and provides an opportunity for the initiator to explain their concerns and the basis for their action.

**f) Attach Evidence/s** - Encouraging the attachment of evidence substantiates the VoNC, allowing for a fact-based evaluation and safeguarding against baseless claims.

**g) Feedback** - The feedback section provides an additional avenue for open communication and improvements to the process.

## Opportunity to be Heard

Once a VoNC complaint form is submitted, the Governance Community Manager (GCM)1 shall, within forty-eight (48) hours, share the complaint to the subject/s of the VoNC (Accused) and be given three (3) calendar days to submit a defense addressing said complaint. 

## Peer Evaluation

In the same 24 hour-period, the GCM shall also require the rest of the council, to which the Accused is from, to complete a peer evaluation on the Accused within three (3) days from notice. 

## Posting in Governance Ideas

Within three (3) days, the GCM shall post the complaint, defense, and results of the peer evaluation which shall be posted in Governance Ideas together with the complaint and defense in one post within forty-eight (48) hours.

## Dao Voting

The VoNC post shall be kept open for DAO voting for five (5) days. A minimum upvotes shall escalate the VoNC to a snapshot vote

## Snapshot Voting

If the threshold of fifty (50) upvotes is reached within five days, the GCM shall initiate a Snapshot vote within forty-eight (48) hours where ILV stakers will have three (3) days to vote. Voting power will be calculated by election vILV processes. (i.e. vILV will be calculated quadratically)

## Outcome and Replacement of a Removed Council Member

This shall follow the process outlined in Gov v2.

## Timeline

Submit VoNC complaint > 48 hours > GCM shares the complaint with the Accused to draft a defense & requires appropriate council to complete Peer Evaluation on the Accused > 3 days > GCM receives Peer Eval and defense > 48 hours > GCM post in Governance Ideas > 5 days > Close post > 50 upvotes received > 48 hours > Snapshot vote > 3 days > Outcome = Total Days 17 

## Impact of VoNC to Council Pay

If a VoNC is ongoing at the end of any council pay period, the Accused council member's pay will be withheld until the VoNC process concludes. If the outcome of the VonC is against the Accused, the Accused will not be eligible to be paid his/her council pay for the said council pay period nor the succeeding council pay period regardless of time served.

## Rationale:

At its core, this proposal is driven by the fundamental principles of transparency, fairness, and accountability within the Illuvium DAO. The initiation process is structured to be open and accessible, making Discord ID optional to ensure the privacy and security of those with valid concerns. What sets this proposal apart is its commitment to merit-based evaluations. A VoNC is determined by the weight of allegations and evidence rather than the identity of the complainant, ensuring an impartial and objective process. 

## Use Case:
Whistleblowing mechanisms in Web 2.0 Companies, and Vote of No Confidence in Parliament
