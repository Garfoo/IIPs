## Simple Summary:
This proposal modifies Illuvium's governance structure. The proposed structure consists of specialised sub-councils and a central council for improved scalability and decentralisation.

## Abstract:
The proposed new governance structure for Illuvium addresses issues such as lack of communication, lack of team input and council members making decisions outside their expertise, and prioritises decentralisation by implementing sub-councils for specific segments of governance.
