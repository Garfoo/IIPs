## Simple Summary:

This proposal aims to significantly widen Illuvium Beyond’s reach and utilize the power of affiliate marketing to capture the attention of the broader Web 3 and NFT space. It will enable a simple affiliate link program that will return a portion of revenue generated through D1sk purchases to the partner that shared the affiliate link.

## Abstract:

The marketing team will distribute specialized affiliate links on a case-by-case basis to influencers in different categories across crypto. Anyone who uses this link and purchases D1sks using ETH will have a portion of that ETH held by the DAO in the ‘Affiliate Vault’ and then manually distributed to the influencer as per their prior agreement.

## Overview:

The marketing team will reach out to current major Illuvium supporters and other entities that they have built a relationship with in the past. Based on their reach and additional metrics, the team will create suitable terms before giving an affiliate link to the partner.Upon a user's click on the link, any D1sk acquisitions made through ETH during that session will be recorded, with the corresponding percentage of ETH set aside in a distinct wallet designated as the 'Affiliate Vault,' exclusively for this purpose.. The Illuvium dev team has already clarified that the systems are in place to action this immediately.If the consumer navigates away from the page at any point, they will need to use the link again to record these new purchases.. If a consumer uses sILV2 for their purchase, 100% of the sILV2 is burnt and the affiliate marketing entity will not receive any reward from this user.

Once the ETH surpasses a specific threshold, we will transfer the funds to layer 1, execute a swap on the open market, and subsequently distribute the resulting amount as USDC or ILV, contingent upon the terms of the partner's agreement.. This will become an automated task and the affiliate program will be available to more participants.

If an affiliate partner violates the Terms and Conditions accessible on Illuvium.io we will terminate their link..

When considering revenue distribution, we will classify the portion assigned to the affiliate partner as marketing costs and exclude its distribution to stakeholders. ICC-P3 covers this system, incorporating the following statement: 'Commission and affiliate marketing products will also follow the relevant distribution strategy, with revenue reduced by associated costs'. - https://snapshot.org/#/ilvgov.eth/proposal/0x245e440c3b517a0b7a7ff11c2c038cfd96c503ab9cbf3e593bd8d7c73cd07fae

## Rationale:

Many industries have shown just how powerful affiliate marketing can be. This marketing strategy aims to expand the DAOs marketing reach with the assistance of hundreds of significant influencers that either already cover Illuvium or that have heard of the brand’s name but need more incentive to discuss the project. Allowing them to generate revenue from their audience’s participation in Illuvium Beyond, it incentivises them to promote Illuvium products and market the game on our behalf with no added cost to the DAO.

As this extends beyond the core community, the potential for attracting new users to discover Illuvium and engage with Beyond significantly increases. Even for our established community members, the opportunity to contribute to their favourite influencers' success could motivate them to acquire more D1sks, realizing its positive impact on the community.

Aside from the overall increase in revenue and participants in Illuvium Beyond, a marketing strategy like this will also help the team create future data-driven strategies. They will be able to see which influencers perform the best, the average spend of users from different communities and the general reach of our partners. Leveraging these valuable insights will increase the rate of success heading into Open Beta.

## Conclusion:

The team is diligently developing a game poised to excel within the realm of Web 3. Their most formidable tool for expanding the player base lies in organic referrals. By establishing and refining these systems early and progressively enhancing them in the coming months, Illuvium can amplify the impact of its compact marketing team by establishing an extensive network of influencers, all driven by the shared aspiration to contribute to Illuvium's success.
